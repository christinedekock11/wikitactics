NASA data in no way supports the \"Ahmadiyya\" prophecy claim. I request you to stop bringing original research into this. I have already provided you with four references containing proofs and views by a variety of sources that counter the fulfillment of the prophecy claim. Remember, the prophecy itself claims that the lunar eclipse should happen on the 1st day of Ramadan and the solar eclipse on the middle day of the month (15th). There are currently two views being shared on the article as of now, the view of critics claiming that it is weak and the view of \"Ahmadis\" that it is sound. There however is no information (as of now) on the article indicating a crucial view that the prophecy was not fulfilled in the first place. The criticism that the prophecy has not been fulfilled should be shared and there are two major points for this view, the first being that the solar eclipse and lunar eclipses did not occur on the days prophecized and the second point is that the prophecy itself applies prior to the arrival of the Mahdi, not after. This is clearly expressed on page 100 of \"Muhammad is the Last Prophet\" by Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizvi.", "username": "Xtremedood", "rebuttal_labels": ["DH4: Repeated argument"], "coordination_labels": []}, {"text": "You are again muddling up the issue.

In this context the quotes would indicate that the term is not quite right, probably anachronistic.

The evidence for this is overwhelming in both the linguistic and historical record. It should be made clear in the opening paragraph that this is the widespread view accepted by most scientific scholars. The fringe theory that Malayalam has an older root independent from Tamil is not equatable.\n(2) During the\u00a0ancient period\u00a0Kerala formed part of a larger linguistic area called\u00a0Tamilakam, 'The Tamil speaking region'. Much of the extensive\u00a0ancient Tamil literature was composed in Kerala including\u00a0Tolk\u0101ppiyam,\u00a0Ainkurunuru,\u00a0Pathitrupathu\u00a0and\u00a0Silappatikaram. There is no doubt that the language of literature in Kerala was\u00a0Standard Old Tami\u1e3b (centami\u1e3b) at the time and this should be mentioned on the page. Internal historical evidence from the said literature clearly shows a Tamil consciousness among the people of Kerala, who saw themselves as speaking Tamil in a Tamil region.\n(3) A slightly different spoken colloquial dialect, preserving some archaic features not found in any of the literary works of Tamil must have also been present in Kerala at the time. This accounts for the differences which has led some fringe scholars (e.g. Govindakutty) to claim an independent origin.

Their demands only arose in February and were part of the occupation, so I think it makes more sense to put that part of the text in the 'Occupation' section.\n3. I added a link to the actual text of 'Profiel 2016' as it came out in November 2014.\n4. I fixed the inaccurate conflation between Profiel 2016 as it came out in November 2014, which did not contain the following plans: 'Masters degree courses with fewer than 20 students would be eliminated, and only three PhD students would be supported at any given time'. That was in the so-called 'houtskoolschets' leaked in early February, so I clarified that.

There are AT LEAST 5 Lebanese billionaires living in Africa that are not included in Forbes and co. nor the list I compiled. Why? Because these guys' fortune, well above 1 billion USD, is unknown. It could be 1, it could be 10. Their assets are \"undercover\". Also, and contrary to you Anglo-Saxon thinking, it is common practice in the Middle East to talk about FAMILIES. Forbes MENA (the regional version of Forbes) recently released its list of \"RICHEST\" and it was a list of... MENA's RICHEST FAMILIES!!! That's the way it works around here: FAMILY WEALTH! Because nobody, including Forbes (!) and hence I trust you will agree neither of you too, can or will ever be able to breakdown the wealth of individual family members.

Ron Chernow, who represents the academic view, informed readers on p. 111 of his 2011 Pulitzer prize-winning biography, ''Washington: A Life,'' \"However horrifying it seems to later generations, abominable behavior toward dark-skinned people was considered an acceptable way of life.\" On p. 6 he wrote, \"George Washington entered a strictly hierarchical universe [...] As the economic basis of this undemocratic world, slavery was commonplace and unquestioned...\" On p. 8, \"Like her future husband, Martha Dandridge grew up in a world where slavery was taken for granted...\"\nWhile I'm utterly opposed to hagiographies, I can't agree to portray GW as a racist or a torturer. We should portray him in the context of the world in which he lived. This does a far greater service to our readers than a judgmental view applying 21st-century ideas to the actions of 18th-century people. Here are excerpts from an excellent essay, \"Against Presentism,\" by Lynn Hunt:\nWho isn't [against presentism], you say? Hardly any ism\" these days has much of a scholarly following.\"\nOver time, modernity became the standard of judgment against which most of the past, even the Western past, could be found wanting.\nPresentism, at its worst, encourages a kind of moral complacency and self-congratulation. Interpreting the past in terms of present concerns usually leads us to find ourselves morally superior; the Greeks had slavery, even David Hume was a racist, and European women endorsed imperial ventures. Our forbears constantly fail to measure up to our present-day standards. This is not to say that any of these findings are irrelevant or that we should endorse an entirely relativist point of view. It is to say that we must question the stance of temporal superiority that is implicit in the Western (and now probably worldwide) historical discipline.\nRespect for the past, with its concomitant humility, curiosity, and even wonder . . . enables us to see beyond our present-day concerns backward and forward at the same time.  \t\t\t\t\tFalse\n\n4\t2018-06-30 07:18:00\tYopienso\tEDIT /* Early years (1732\u20131752) */ copyedit\t\t\t\t\tTrue\n\n4\t2018-06-30 07:20:00\tYopienso\tEDIT /* Early years (1732\u20131752) */\t\t\t\t\tTrue\n\n4\t2018-06-30 07:24:00\tYopienso\tEDIT /* Early years (1732\u20131752) */ (Whoops--accidentally saved s/o edit summary that I followed Chernow&#039;s observation that little George didn&#039;t manage Ferry Farm--his mother did.)

Slavery in America, except a punishiment for (a) crime(s), was abolished in 1865.\nThese articles are good: Slavery in Britain, Slavery in the colonial United States, and Slavery in the United States.\nSlavery was often times cruel, but more than often it was not. Fighting wars was ten times as cruel. Jefferson gives us a classic example of how slaves were well taken care of, worked no more than free farmers, allowed to raise their own chickens and produce, had Sundays, Christmas and Easter off, encouraged to attend church, and didn't do much in the late autumn and winter months, but were still well fed and provided for. Admittedly, Washington could have done better. In cities like Philadelphia, New York and Boston, Africans were taken in as house servants by mostly Christian families who detested slavery.

Why then, one might wonder would there be such fierce opposition to an entry in the article that attempts to address this imbalance as one step toward the removal of the Wikipedia warning banner? Claims of coatracking: Revelations of big game hunting by the founder and potential implications of a boycott were deemed by the Wall Street Journal and many other major news outlets to be worthy of coverage. This was a major news event, not a tangential one. Although it was the actions of the company owner that brought the media spotlight, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out, there were potential implications for the company in general. The IP address commenter above indicates concerns with Due and Undue Weight, but the Wikipedia entry defining that concept states that \"Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources...\" which seems to indicate that the boycott should be mentioned and referenced to the Wall Street Journal and other articles.

Acorn should also be proud of its other work, including winning minimum-wage increases and helping lead the fight against predatory lending and unfair foreclosures.\nMr. Obama's willingness to sacrifice because of his deep commitment to strengthening the democratic process is something that all Americans should applaud regardless of their party or politics.\n''Sanford A.

It was written first with French lyrics in 1960.  It was first recorded in English by Kathy Kirby of the UK in 1965.  She employed the same pronoun use that is the basis of the debate over the interpretation.  So it has nothing to do with Cher being androgynous or \"gender neutral\".  Cher simply did not change the lyrics.  So should she be credited for them?''\n'2) It is very unlikely that a 1965 easy listening/adult contemporary song such as this was supposed to make any statement or reference to lesbianism or homosexuality in any way.  You are interpreting this with a 21st Century mentality.''\n'3) Vicki Carr included the song on an album which was produced by Snuff Garrett, the same man who produced this song for Cher.  He approved of the lyric being altered from the original Kathy Kirby (and later Cher) version to \"What will you do when he sets you free?  Just the way that he said goodbye to me\".  So after he produced Cher's recording he realized the confusion or \"mistake\" in the song and corrected it.''\n'4) Contrary to initial reaction, it was later understood that the original version was likely a woman who is suffering from her own recent jilting, and thus is giving this advice to another girl or woman.  She then, lamenting her own situation, turns to direct that last line to the man who left her (\"Just the way that you said goodbye to me\"), as he was on her mind the whole time she was giving the advice, which itself is based on this recent loss.''\n'5) Because Joe Viglione of Allmusic may have inferred the homosexual reference does not supersede all the evidence here.  Many, MANY songs are often misunderstood or misinterpreted at first by the listening public.''\n'6) The analysis of this (or any) one specific song does not really belong on a page that is about Cher in general.  It is too off-topic, even if she was the original recording artist or it had been written for her (and all the gender theories were emphatically true), but it was not.  This discussion belongs on the Wikipedia page for the song itself, which already exists.''\n'7) Finally, other than this dubious, weak and misguided reference, what other examples are there that Cher herself sang gender-neutral songs?   Can you cite any?  Having a deeper, contralto range does not in and of itself lend her songs to being construed as \"androgynous\".''\nAnyone who is a Cher fan or Wikipedia aficionado should want only the most accurate and pertinent information to be included in its articles.

I challenge you to find a modern piece of writing on Murphy that doesn't address her racism.\nThe penalties became much more severe in the early 1920s when a massive drug panic, closely tied to a renewed campaign for Chinese Exclusion, swept the nation. It started when the practiced social reformer Emily Murphy published a series of five sensationalist articles in Maclean's magazine. In them, she described the physical and moral deterioration of addicts and explained that drug use led white women to sleep with blacks and Asians, posing a serious threat to the white race. The first article was accompanied by a spooky drawing of a hand with long fingernails holding a Chinese tablet, a picture of a wizened Asian man with smoke coming out of his ears, and a photo of an Asian man smoking a pipe, making it clear that this was a Chinese menace.  Catherine Carstairs (assistant professor of history at UBC) on The Racist Roots of Canada's Drug Laws in \"Beaver\" a Canadian history journal.\nWhen, in 1924, a Chinese cafe-owner in Regina challenged a law forbidding him to hire white women, much of Canada's liberal and progressive leadership seems to have gone mad with sexual frenzy. Chatelaine magazine, Alberta magistrate Emily Murphy, the local Council of Women and the Regina Women's Labour League all spouted racist paranoia about the perils of white women in the clutches of \"yellow\" men.

There an obvious tendency for people from a particular political persuasion to attempt to tar Murphy with the brush of racism (e.g. John Akpata, as outlined above).

The quote from Collections Canada is probably useable in our article because it is demonstrably true. But it too needs the full context:\nIn The Black Candle and other writings, Emily Murphy expressed stereotypical and prejudiced views about various racial and ethnic groups.

I'm not on expert on her, but have read the Black Candle and other bits about her and am somewhat familiar with the context in which she is writing. Certainly, definitions do very, and the fact that the label \"racist\" is perjorative may make it seem that the subject is being insulted rather than described in an encyclopedic sort of way, i.e., not in a NPOV. There is, however, enough of a consensus in the world we live in that racism is a fairly clearly-defined phenomenon, and her racism does not detract from her role in the first wave feminist movement: saying she subscribed to a racist worldview is not the same as saying she was a jerk. Maybe she was a jerk, maybe she wasn't, but that's not the issue here. Some of the arguments here sound like the validity of the concept itself is in dispute. The controversial notion here, in light of established Canadian history, is that Murphy was NOT racist. For this reason, I think those making that claim are required to produce the evidence to the contrary, and I believe that would constitute original research.\nSome reasons why I don't find these arguments credible:\n-one does not have to be a simplistic \"knee jerk\" racist to be a racist.  Racists have gone to great pains to develop sophisticated analyses. Murphy was addressing an educated audience, and was trying to present a sophisticated worldview, which happened to be racist. No one's saying her racism was vulgar.\n-context has little to do with it unless someone's views are being distorted by not accounting for the context in which they lived. Just because it was normal for educated, middle class women in positions of influence to subscribe to the view that, for example, the white race was threatened, does not mean that they were not racist (what exactly was posing the danger to the white race if not other races?). The term is \"presentism\" when you import a modern notion back to an era when that notion did not exist, and consequently misrepresent that era. That is not the case here, because the concept \"race\" did exist and people like Murphy subscribed to it and propagated it. It was also normal for Chinese and other non-whites to complain about racial discrimination, and occasionally, engage in acts of resistance.\n-There is no question that Emily Murphy believed a) that race was a natural, biologically determined category, and b)that racial categories existed in a hierarchy and ought to be treated as such, i.e., white people were superior to non-whites, etc. This understanding is no longer accepted as valid by credible authorities on the subject - and is racist.\nThese issues are important because Emily Murphy was influential in the legal establishment, and therefore had a role in laws that people were forced to live under. The early war on drugs absolutely was racist and racially targeted people for discrimation. White women being lured into the drug scene by scary black men and shifty Chinamen was alarming to Murphy and others of her ilk. Perhaps she represented a step forward from the Asiatic Exclusion League because she did not feel the remedy was mob violence. In any case, the race section of the article seems more concerned with defending her from charges of racism than describing the significance of her views on race, and needs fixing.

What I am saying is that we cannot state ''in an encyclopeda article'' that \"Murphy was a racist\" unless we have a citation from a reputable source who is basing his or her comment on analysis of proven facts rather than merely stating an opinion.

Some of us are keen to focus the topic of the article not simply on people who prominently are known for not accepting the consensus on climate, but on the pattern of denial that emerges from people associated with conservative think tanks (that have often received substantial funding from fossil fuel industrial interests), which crucially ''has been identified by scholarly sources''. (As it stands, the lede certainly is unclear and potentially POV - it can be read to imply that all denial is for political or commercial gain.) So, for example, the phrase \"has been associated with\" becomes by definition correct, as it's that kind of opposition to climate change science that sources generally examine, not opposition everywhere at all times. In these sources, the difference between scientific scepticism and attempts to bypass or ape scientific procedures in the political goal of attacking AGW is made very clear. The lede as it stands does not make this distinction, and it's remiss that it does not. I recommend the Oreskes book (well, I'm halfway through it now, so that far at least) as being very well written and very clear about the issue - which is non-science based, politically motivated denialism, not the minority opinions of legitimate scientists.

By this, I don't mean that the article should presume Oreskes and the many other writers who say much the same are correct in their analyses, but at the very least it should be clear about what their case is, and what is beyond reasonable doubt (such as the strong association between prominent denialism and conservative institutes, and these conservative institutes' financial connection to fossil fuel companies.)

(I remain skeptical of the very notion that one doctoral degree can have a lower or higher position than the others although certainly people hold varying opinions, particularly based on the duration of the programs, about the rigor and value of those degrees.)\nFirst, none of the military citations I've read indicate that any difference in the treatment of doctors and lawyers in the U.S. armed services are attributable to the degree itself rather than the profession they practice in the armed forces.\nSecond, I think that the Mwenda source actually suggests that the MD cannot properly be viewed as any kind of doctorate. It quotes from another source (Phillips and Pugh) that suggests the MD is a bachelor's degree: \"[G]eneral medical practitioners are given the honorary title of Doctor although they do not have a doctorate from their universities. Indeed, on the basis of their university course they are credited with two bachelor's degrees...\" (90). (It's not even clear to me that Mwenda is referring to the American academia in this statement.) Mwenda also apparently regards the JD as a kind of second-entry bachelor's degree: \"[T]he U.S. law degree program is neither a master's degree nor a doctorate\" (87). In Mwenda's worldview, as I read it, the only kind of doctorate is the PhD and other dissertation doctorates. I suggest that this is a fringe viewpoint when describing American higher ed. Indeed, on pages 89-90, Mwenda states that \"most professional doctorates, unlike a JD, have both taught and research components, culminating in the presentation of a thesis or dissertation,\" and Mwenda cites the DBA and DEng degrees as proper professional doctorates. The Wikipedia pages on the DBA and DEng describes them as a research doctorates. Thus, while I understand Mwenda's point, I view it as (1) an argument for how the author thinks things ought to be conceptualized and (2) contrary to the consensus view of professional doctorates in the United States.\nThird, the U. Michigan statement was simply that the JD is not the same as a traditional higher-ed doctorate, like the Ph.D. I understand that statement to mean the JD is not a research doctorate, which I think we all agree on. I don't read it as saying the JD is inferior to the PhD. And I don't see how it relates at all to the MD.\nAlso, I think you dismiss Sawagner201's point too quickly. Even the Mwenda source describes some evidence that the LLM and SJD degrees are \"'illegitimate' children\" in the family of law degrees (93). Mwenda notes that the LLM and SJD degrees \"do not attract much professional respect or recognition from many quarters of the U.S. legal profession\" (93), and, indeed, at the Cornell Law School \"in exceptional cases\" a JSD or LLM candidate can transfer to the JD program. Mwenda condemns the whole system as \"illogical\" (95). However they are regarded, I am not convinced they can be seen as \"higher\" degrees in a \"vertical\" progression with the JD at the base of the progression.\nFor those editors who wish to view the Mwenda source directly, it is accessible at bit(dot)ly/b4F4qq. After reading it over again, I wonder if this source is a \"questionable source\" under Wikipedia's rules because the views it expresses are \"widely acknowledged as extremist\" (such as the MD is not any kind of doctorate) and \"rel[ies] heavily on rumors and personal opinions.\" Look, for instance at how Mwenda quotes extensively on page 91 from a blog post on one lawyer's blog.

This Christian Holocaust is viewed as the precursor to the Jewish Holocaust in WWII. To this day, the Turkish government ostensibly denies having committed this genocide. Prof. Israel Charney, President of the IAGS\nTurks admit that the Armenian persecution is the first step in a plan to get rid of Christians, and that Greeks would come next. ... Turkey henceforth is to be for Turks alone. Peter Balakian, The Burning Tigris, quoting the New York Times, September 14, 1915.\nWhile the death toll in the trenches of Western Europe were close to 2 million by the summer of 1915, the extermination of innocent civilians in Turkey (the Armenians, but also Syrian and Assyrian Christians and large portions of the Greek population, especially the Greeks of Pontos, or Black Sea region) was reaching 1 million. Peter Balakian, The Burning Tigris, p. 285-286.\nIn an article for the August 1, 1926 edition of the Los Angeles Examiner, Mustafa Kemal (Atat\u00fcrk) also affirms the slaughters. Kemal writes:\"those ... left-over from the former Young Turkish Party, ... should have been made to account for the lives of millions of our Christian subjects who were ruthlessly driven en masse, from their homes and massacred ...\"\nMustafa Kemal \u2014 Emile Hildebrand, \"Kemal Promises More Hangings of Political Antagonists in Turkey,\" Los Angeles Examiner, August 1, 1926 (Sunday edition, Section VI).\nIf members of the United Nations pass appropriate legislation such incidents such as pogroms of Czarist Russian and the massacres of Armenians and Greeks by Turkey would be punishable as genocide. \"Genocide Under the Law of Nations,\" New York Times, January 5, 1947.\nLes pers\u00e9cutions antihell\u00e9niques poursuivies en Turquie depuis le d\u00e9but de la guerre europ\u00e9enne ne sont que la continuation du plan d'extermination de l'Hell\u00e9nisme mis, depuis 1913, en pratique par les Jeunes-Turcs. Translation: \"The anti-Greek persecutions carried out in Turkey since the beginning of the European War are but the continuation of the plan of extermination of Hellenism practiced by the Young Turks, since 1913.\" From the reports of diplomatic and consular officials.\n... the Greeks of Anatolia are suffering the same or worse fate than did the Armenians in the massacres of the Great War. The deportation of the Greeks is not limited to the Black Sea Coast but is being carried out throughout the whole of the country governed by the Nationalists. Greek villages are deported entire, the few Turkish or Armenian inhabitants are forced to leave, and the villages are burned. The purpose is unquestionably to destroy all Greeks in that territory and to leave Turkey for the Turks. These deportations are, of course, accompanied by cruelties of every form just as was true in the case of the Armenian deportations five and six years ago.

That is false imprisonment, assault, harassment, hate crime and attempt of assault to do great bodily harm. Don't you agree? If you think about it from Vang's point of view, you apologized for being on their land and just want to leave without any problems, then you have 8 people who just followed you on ATVs and confronted you again with hostility, they're angry and swearing at you calling you racial slurs, one of them just said that he was going to beat you up, and then you try to walk away but another person stepped in your way and blocked you from leaving.

Another thing to add is that many in the community doesn't believe that race wasn't a factor and the Attorney General downplayed the racial angle in court but the Hmong community still felt that racism was a factor in the shooting.  Another reaction to add is that bumper stickers were made and sold in shops saying Save a Deer, Shoot a Hmong and that  Vang's home was burned down in a suspicious fire and it is speculated that it was arson because of the profane graffiti defacing Vang's home.\nFor the investigation section: It should be explained in the beginning of the section that after Vang apologized for being on their land and was leaving, the 8 victims pursued Vang on ATV's and confronted him again with a very heated atmosphere unlike the first confrontation. The facts after the heated second confrontation is what was in dispute that led to the shootings. \" On the stand Hesebeck admitted Robert Crotteau had called Vang a 'Hmong ahole.\" It should be added following that sentence that, Lauren Hesebeck shortly after the shooting told investigators that Robert Crotteau had threatened Vang that he was going to give Vang a beating, called Vang derogatory names tagged with Hmong, and Joey Crotteau stepped in Vang's way blocking Vang from trying to walk away.", "username": "Drcrazy102", "rebuttal_labels": ["DH6: Refutation"], "coordination_labels": []}, {"text": "I made some changes.

The second confrontation happened when the victims pursed Vang on ATV's and caught up to him and surrounded him.

I don't know why there's someone like you editing this article without knowledge of all the details of this case. You can even look at a small part of it in the article.

That happened in 1348 but in year 1349 former Moravian Margrave the Charles renounced his rule in Moravia and gave it to his brother John Henry of Luxembourg and he ruled Moravia ever after until his death in 1375, then his son Jobs of Moravia inherited his title and so continued to rule in the Moravian Margaviate (but he never was the King of Bohemia!), in 1411 he was even elected the King of the Romans and so ruled in the entire empire and before that he was for example the Elector of Brandenburg (ruler of Brandenburg). But he died the same year he was elected the King, so then Bohemian Kings ruled in the Margaviate until 1419 (so in 1411-1419) and then again in 1458-1469 (In 1464 the King of Bohemia declared Moravian Magraviate as equal to the Bohemian Kingdom, in 1469-1490 Moravians rejected the Bohemian King and elected their own Matthias Corvinus) and again in 1490-1526 (but it was Jagiellon dynasty) and then since 1526 Moravia was, together with Bohemia but not as a part of Bohemia, one of the crownlands of the Hapsburg Empire (1526\u20131918) but 1608-1611 Matthias of Austria ruled the estate of Moravia so not the same man as the Bohemian King (because Moravia rejected the Bohemian King again), so Moravia had again a different ruler than Bohemia. Moravia had its own diet, law, courts, constitution, territory, army, etc. independent on Bohemia until 1749 (reign of Maria Theresia, Moravia and Bohemia de facto ceased to exist) and again but this time only partially since 1790 until 1918. Then in 1918 Moravia together with Bohemia, Slovakia, etc. formed the first Czechoslovakia but it remained a separate land from Bohemia, with its own capital city, president and so on (subdued to the Czechoslovakia, not Bohemia). And as far as I know Moravia had to accept the King of Bohemia as a ruler, he couldn't just rule without the land (Moravia) accepting him. (I am sorry I wrote this in haste.)

If she has not, she isn\u00b4t a source at all, it\u00b4s mere affirmations.

You did ask for an explanation, after all.\nI hope this is an answer to your question: maybe editorializing is not the thing wrong with \"Things like replacing \"central authority\" with 'State'\", but a Wikipedia article content page is still definitely a wrong venue for taking sides. Calling it an \"authority\" means that it has the right to do what it's doing, and if it's abused and exceeded its authority, then that's an abuse that somehow isn't really an abuse. Whichever of multiple similar rules apply here, the rule or rules definitely forbid using judgemental language. For example, you might as well call Siad Barre's administration \"the heroes\" as call them \"the villains\" or \"the regime\", and you might as well call UNOSOM \"the rescuers\", \"the war machine\" or \"the foreign interlopers\" as call a State \"the authorities\" or \"central authority\". It's a package deal - once you allow an administration to be called a \"regime\", or a State to be called an \"authority\", central or otherwise, so many people will so passionately try to put their POV in there, you might as well just lock any page that says anything about politics or the State so only admins can edit it. So Barre's administration is called nothing more or less than that - his administration. It's not as if you can't have your opinion about his administration, and it's not as if there aren't public venues where you may express that opinion to an audience. I have an opinion about it too - which is why I don't have to be reminded of it.\nAnother thing going on here is that  seems to be treating accuracy as the same thing as objectivity, as if all truths were objectively true. I am not sure that he knows I questioned only the alleged objectivity of the statement that the UN gave authority to the troop movements to take place, rather than the alleged truth of the statement. I tried explaining it to him at length, and as I post this, he has not yet responded. This will be what passes for clear upon visiting the section of the talk page I sent you.\nThis is going to be a long, caffeinated, meandering explanation the length, caffeination, and meandering of which and its presence in a conversation in which so far people have had an unexpected and severe difficulty in communicating with each other necessitates an explicit, kind of bizarre but, on its own terms, quite logical writing style. Where applicable, the explanation's information structure is given a rudimentary, explicit marking with the \"[FOCUS] f\" syntax. Consider the all-caps text in the square brackets followed with the sub-scripted letter FOXTROT to be in focus. Otherwise, consider the text in those of the square brackets that do not make the contents into a link, to be the nonce attitudinal.\n[The following sentence [ESTABLISHES THE REASON WHY WHAT'S LEFT OF THE EXPLANATION IS BEING MADE] f.] You also asked about the reason for the upper case letter Sierra.\n[The following sentence [IS THE THESIS] f.] The reason [IS CLARITY] f.\n[The following paragraph [IS A SUPPORTING ARGUMENT FOR THE THESIS] f.] [WHEN THE FIRST LETTER IN A SENTENCE IS LOWER CASE, WHEN THE WORD \"State\" IS AT THE FRONT OF A SENTENCE, AND WHEN ALL THE LETTERS ARE UPPER CASE] f, the word \"State\" is ambiguous.

This is opaque in English because [IN AMERICAN ENGLISH, THE WORD \"GOVERNMENT\" MEANS 'State', BUT IN OTHER DIALECTS OF ENGLISH, THE WORD \"GOVERNMENT\" MEANS \"ADMINISTRATION\"] f . For an example of the State-administration distinction, when Tony Blair left office, his administration ended, but not because of any armed insurgency that would have taken the countryside and cities that aren't London by force of arms. But Barre's State ended because he was no longer hypocritical enough to sustain the clan loyalty he exhibited that kept him loyal to his power base despite making clan loyalty illegal, but more relevantly his State ended because his power base retaliated against his State by no longer being his power base and by coming to support one or more of the active armed insurgencies that took the countryside, and ultimately the country, by force of arms.

If we take an approach to communist mass work more globally (outside the scope of 1950s USA), we find that in most cases members and sympathizers of pro-communist mass organizations are: 1) well aware of the partisan links of the organization and 2) has sympathy towards the party organization.\nMass organizations should be understood in the following context: A Communist Party is, per definition, a vanguard party. To be a member of the party, you have to have a certain level of ideological formation and be willing to commit time and effort to party work. Many people, who might be sympathizers of the party, are not able/willing to assume this task. Thus the party creates mass organizations, usually along sectors (youth, students, trade unions, women, peasants, cultural associations, etc.), to which membership is open for anyone willing to join. The maximum programme of the mass organization coincides with minimum programme of the party.\nThat said, mass organizations are not a uniquely communist phenomenon.

Speaking Greek does not make you Greek, just as speaking English does not make us British or American. Tomorrow perhaps our grandchildren will speak Mandarin, so it does not really tell much about someones lineage. Also when you mention Christian Orthodoxy it is important to emphasize that these is Albanian Orthodoxy and Greek Orthodoxy.They are not one and this is a very important distinction, although it might seem minor at fist sight. As you probably know, Albanians are not very religious people, so religion is not a good criteria to divide them in groups. There are exceptions to this though, but it is common to find Albanians of different religions and regions that have mixed with one another. Remember that Ali Pasha's wife Vasiliqi was Christian whereas he was muslim himself. Similar examples you will find everywhere and they are a sign of a modern society (signs of open-mindedness, tolerance, mobility). Coming back to the subject person. Spiro Thoma Koleka was not Greek, neither part of a minority. it will be impossible for anyone to prove Spiros Greek lineage because it is just a myth. For your info, it is very difficult to find an ethnic Greek (note the word Greek, I am not saying Greek speaking) in the village of Vuno. There are many in Dhermi and in some neighborhoods of the other villages, but in Vuno there are more polar bears than ethnic Greeks!

You got to travel freely, work in the EU area, get state assistance in case of unemployment, healthcare covered etc. So, for a poor Albanian working all day for 300\u20ac a month, it was not a bad thing to have an additional passport. Also many older people have gotten a Greek passport and get a free pension that is higher than the average salary in Albania (no wonder how the Greek state has a black hole of 300 Billion Euros, they have been giving away free money all over the place). Anyway, getting the passport does not make you ethnic Greek, it just makes you ALSO a Greek CITIZEN, besides Albanian. Dual citizenship in Albania is allowed, so who am I to say that it is bad.

Greek schools operated in Orthodox Albanian villages in the latter part of the 19th century. Greek identity as understood today amongst them was not present prior to these events of the late nineteenth century. Being identified as Greek just meant Orthodox in past times.

The number of men migrating away from Vuno towards Greece, Italy or elsewhere was very high. The village was not big enough to have a sustainable and thriving economy, without its immigrants it was unable to survive. I don't think that anyone living in Greece would have wanted to migrate to Vuno.

It will be published sometime though. The publication will include our family tree from 1560, there you will see also where Edi Rama and other important figures of the past fit.

That is why I insist in correcting this article and will do so until it is accurate for the public. The inaccuracies about Himara and Vuno are appalling as well. As you point out, Himara is not just a city but a whole Region including the villages around it. There are strong interests to call Himara Greek. The Greek state has thrown countless millions of euros to \"buy\" the history of Himara by giving pensions, passports, benefits but also by political intimidation towards the weak Albanian state (Greece is part of the EU, as we know). In some villages of Himara the presence of grecophiles has increased over the years, many people have acquired Greek names and passports, however their family roots are very easy to uncover and the absolute majority is Albanian. As a proof that Spiro was not greek, please refer to his Gravestone picture (http://i.imgur.com/pAJ5FLt.jpg). His name is not written in Greek (\u03a3\u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) form and alphabet, but in Albanian. So his fathers name, written as Thoma and not \u0398\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2.

In Macedonia, there were many cases where Greek bands went into Slavic villages coercing them to side with Greek cause (see: Anastasia Karakasidou: 'Fields of wheat, hills of Blood' book). How is one Greek in that case? During that era, as Nitsiakos clearly states, Orthodox Albanians were confused in the latter part of the 19th century regarding their identity, due in part to the emergence of the national Albanian movement.

It doesn't offer a final answer, but it shows that Giazotto did use some kind of source. The following is an edited Google translation of the relevant passage (Nicola Schneider: ''La tradizione delle opere di Tomaso Albinoni a Dresda'', tesi di laurea specialistica, Facolt\u00e0 di musicologia dell'Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Pavia, Cremona 2007, pp. 181\u2013186; footnotes are from the original, additions by me are in small type and {curly brackets}):\n{{quotation|But there is another version of the origin of the ''Adagio'', supplied by the same Giazotto, which differs considerably from that of 1958. According to the friendly communication by Remo Giazotto's last assistant and academic collaborator, Dr. Muska Mangano (Verona), the aged musicologist, near death, explained the genesis of the ''Adagio'' again, prompted by an article by Piero Buscaroli {published on 22 September 1992}. The following is Muska Mangano's letter:\nAccording to this testimony, Giazotto received the fragments of the ''Adagio'' at the very beginning of the war without giving notice in his monograph published later.Perhaps because of scruples about the authenticity of the fragment? The discrepancy between the six and the four bars of the first violin mentioned in the versions of 1958 and 1992 respectively should certainly not be taken literally because at that time Giazotto was already very ill. Questions addressed to his heirs about the existence of material relating to his book left in their possession have not produced any results so far, therefore the allegations reported are not verifiable. But shortly before Giazotto's death, Muska Mangano undertook to finish his work on Clementi,Clementi 2002 {= Muzio Clementi: ''Epistolario 1781\u20131831.'' A cura di Remo Giazotto. Skira, Milan 2002}. and among his papers she found related studies and notes, including a modern photocopy of the fragment that had been the source of the ''Adagio'' in the edition of 1958. {...} The appearance of this document in Muska Mangano's possession must be considered an important fact since that copy is the only foothold of the original Dresden source.\nThe paper is a recent photocopy of a modern manuscript bearing in the top right-hand corner a stamp stating unequivocally the Dresden provenance of the original from which it was taken. Since, unfortunately, it is not a frame like those that constituted Giazotto's research material, namely positive images with writing in white on a black background (as seen reproduced in the monograph of 1945), it is difficult to evaluate this document. It should be noted immediately that the copy does not reproduce the basso continuo in print of which one has read many times, but its manual transcription in a handwriting that appears to belong to the first half of the twentieth century. The transcriber was evidently German \u2013 as indicated by the title {Albinoni\u2019s Trio Sonate G moll} \u2013 and wrote down the entire figured bass, inserting the six fragmentary bars of the first violin in their place on the staves. Unfortunately, the photocopy has cut up the writing on the stamp, which thus is not decipherable, but it should be reconstructible by comparison with similar contemporary documents; the words may have contained the name either of the photo studio or of the library that is running the photograph. You can read very well the words below: \u201cDresden. \u2013 Lichtbild | von\u201d. It is unclear what the doubly underlined number \u201c7\u201d refers to, which is located directly below the stamp; it could possibly refer to the number of bars (77 without the 'soli' in bb. 20/21), but this would be an unusual position for a number \u2013 at the top and not at the end of the piece. In any case it cannot be the beginning of a signature because in the Dresden system introduced in the years 1926\u201330 signatures begin with the word 'Mus.' followed by the composer's identification number (Albinoni, in this case, was given the \u201c2199\u201d).\nApparently, a manuscript copy of the printed source was first drawn up in Dresden, in which the melodic fragments of the first violin were then inserted, and from this manuscript the photograph was taken that came to Giazotto. From some source, however, he must have heard about the printed bass part he mentions several times. It is not clear why the Dresden library did not send a frame or a microfilm of this printed part, as they did for all the other sources. When Giazotto sold all the photographic material relating to his work on Albinoni in 1940, he could not foresee what turn the war would take. At that time, the scope of devastation the British fleet would cause in the German city shortly thereafter was unimaginable for all, which is why, perhaps, Giazotto could not calculate the value of his collection of microfilm, which preserved, at least in content, many sources that are no longer available because they burned or were dispersed.E.g. that of the concerto for violin and orchestra Co 3 held at D-Dl, Mus. 2-O-1.\nTalbot and many others have \u201cdisattributed\u201d the ''Adagio'' to Albinoni \u2013 remember that Giazotto never claimed that the piece was all original \u2013 on purely stylistic grounds. The stylistic categories to determine the authenticity of the ''Adagio'' should be applied, if anything, only to the figured bass. To facilitate a comparison of the score in Giazotto's edition, the basso continuo attested by the Dresden copy and the authentic trio sonatasThe op. I and the six sonatas So 20\u201325. by Albinoni, there will be a diplomatic transcription of the page of music at the end of this chapter. When he began to elaborate the figured bass, Giazotto was perhaps mindful of the example of Nikolaus Heinrich Gerber, who under the auspices of Johann Sebastian Bach had worked out an accompaniment on the figured bass of the sonata Op. VI, 6, which Spitta reprinted in the appendix to his work on Bach.Giazotto 1945, p. 84, was aware of it. A comparison of Muska Mangano's copy and the Ricordi score reveals that the bass without the figures in Giazotto's score can be found almost unchanged in the left hand of the organ. One notices slight rhythmic variations in support of the new melody and some advances designed to emphasize the essentially \u201cromantic\u201d character of Giazotto's piece. The original melodic fragments of the first violin are not marked as such, while many expressive and agogic indications (which at that time were not a rarity even in historical-critical editions \u2013 think of Malipiero's editorial practices) are by the modern author. The harmonic progress required by the original figures is largely respected, even if the high concentration of 9\u20138 suspensions, which creates a highly pathetic atmosphere, has no equivalent in the genuine trio sonatas by Albinoni.", "username": "Schneid9", "rebuttal_labels": [], "coordination_labels": ["Providing clarification"]}, {"text": "Does the Dresden \"stamp\" add any plausibility to this? since it would, if true, corroborate what Giazotto had said concerning his discovery (or alleged discovery).

The original preface clearly states that it was \"composed\" by Giazotto on the basis of a printed figured bass and 6 bars of the first violin, and the cover of the Ricordi edition gives Giazotto's name in much larger print than Albinoni's. Still, the preface calls the work a \"reconstruction\", which probably suggested a greater degree of authenticity than was actually warranted, so that later editions and arrangements sometimes omitted Giazotto's name altogether (e.g. , , , , , , ). And, of course, the fact that the ''Adagio'' was often recorded together with real Albinoni works also contributed to the general impression that it was authentic (a few examples from the past: I Musici, Karl Ristenpart, Alain Boulfroy, Jean Witold; more recent ones: , , ).\n(2) As R.D.Tennent said above, Nicola Schneider neither claims nor believes that the sheet of music discovered by Muska Mangano among Giazotto's papers is an 18th century manuscript or even an Albinoni autograph. Instead, he places it in the first half of the 20th century (because of the handwriting) and in Germany (because of the German title \"Albinoni's, Trio Sonate G. moll\" and the fragmentary stamp \"Dresden. Lichtbild von\"  [= Dresden. Photograph by]). If this interpretation is correct (and I see no reason why it shouldn't, except perhaps for the rather awkward spelling of the title \u2013 \"Albinonis Triosonate G-Moll\" would have been more normal), it might be defensible to conclude that Giazotto did base his ''Adagio'' on a source, though we still don't know (a) who wrote the manuscript, (b) if the manuscript was held by a Dresden library or if it was only photographed in Dresden (the Saxon State Library may well have been right in their denial that the manuscript had ever been in their possession!), (c) if Albinoni was the composer. What I don't believe is that the manuscript was based on Giazotto's score: The only person who would have had a reason to do so was Giazotto himself (because he was constantly bothered about his source), so if he really made such a masterful forgery (including the idiosyncratic stamp!), why didn't he produce it during his lifetime?

As for Ashoka, the India page's ancient history section says, \"The (Mauryan) empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.\" So there you have it, all impeccably sourced.  What is ludicrous is that you think that a region controlled by a king, whose name was not even known to Indians until James Prinsep deciphered the Brahmi script, and who ruled some 2,300 years ago, when it took days if not months to even communicate between different regions, would have something like a modern nation state just because his edicts are found in disparate places.", "username": "Fowler&fowler", "rebuttal_labels": ["DH1: Ad hominem/ad argument", "DH6: Refutation"], "coordination_labels": []}, {"text": "RK, the point is that we would need a reliable source that states that India was established in whatever year and then it becomes a point worth discussing.

It is a verbal abbreviation for the word \"thousandth\", and NOTHING MORE. Yes, everyone in industry who uses any thousandth of any unit will say the word \"thou\" as a matter of expediency. Yes, we say \"thou\" even when talking about .001 millimeters. Things like that are the reason the Mars Climate Orbiter crashed. For inches, the unit name is \"Mil\". Anything else is supplementary to that, not vice-versa.\nI have seen ungodly quantities of blueprints and technical documents, in more languages than I can identify. Not one of them has the word \"thou\" on it. Many of them have the word \"mil\", though. That includes blueprints originating from Europe, China, or some other part of the world. In total, I will make a wild guess that there are at least 1 trillion written works that do NOT use the word \"thou\". The word \"thou\" is specious, and it's non-verbal usage is also specious. If it deserves an article, then it is on the same level as ain't. I don't think \"thou\" deserves its own article, but I see nothing wrong with making one.\nWhat I am opposed to is supplanting formal \"Mil\" with informal \"thou\". It makes no sense. It would be equally stupid in any culture, and any language. You don't push aside technical specificity for vague colloquialisms. Somebody tried that once with something important, and it's now twisted up in it's own little crater on Mars. Maybe you should call that guy up ask him how his career is doing, to get an idea of how ridiculous such things are.\nMil is the correct name for the unit of length equal to .001 inch. \"thou\" is a verbal slang abbreviation for the word \"thousand(th)(s)\".

Neuroscientists with a psychology background will study the brain very differently from neuroscientists with a biological or computational background. Hence, there are big differences between behavioral neuroscience and neuroethology, for example. As for the statement that medicine is nothing more than an applied science based on biology, that is just simplistic and does not consider how the various fields are actually organized. For instance, it may seem on the surface that people who study the behavioral and biological aspects of human beings are biologists, but they are actually biological anthropologists. This type of arbitrary convention also applies to the organization of biology and medicine as separate disciplines. I don't doubt there is overlap, but to say one just \"applies\" the knowledge that was developed from the other is simply not true. WP's medicine page does an excellent job of explaining the field.

Neither he nor Nanda was ever called \"king of Lan Na/Chiang Mai\". That title, ''Zinme Bayin'' (\"King of Chiang Mai\"), in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, belonged to Nawrahta Minsaw.

Do modern English-language sources indeed render the native title of ''Ekarit'' as \"emperor\"? Sorry for my scepticism, but I find it always problematic to translate foreign royal titles into a different language, because these titles are usually tied to a certain social and political system and do not have a simple equivalent. Translating royal titles was very common in earlier centuries, but I have the impression that modern historians tend to avoid this practice more and more. A neutral term like \"overlord\" as proposed by  (in a statement that he/she has unfortunately deleted) might be more appropriate. In fact, I had thought of the England/India example, too, once I had saved my above question. But I think there is an essential difference: India, despite being under British suzerainty, was much bigger and more populous than the British mainland. This is not the case with the Burmese vassals, that were either smaller (e.g. Lan Na), or at most, roughly equal (e.g. Ayutthaya). So I think it is still unprecedented to link a higher-ranking title to a less powerful and smaller, less populous dominion. By the way, you have written that Bayinnaung is referred to as ''Min Ekarit'' \"of his vassal states\"; does that mean ''Min Ekarit'' of his vassal states ''in total'' or ''Min Ekarat'' of each of his vassal states individually, i.e. ''Min Ekarit'' of Lan Na, ''Min Ekarit'' of Lan Xang, ''Min Ekarit'' of Ayutthaya etc. I would assume the former. I do not have that much a problem with labelling Bayinnaung an \"emperor\" per se (in the sense of ruler of an \"empire\" that consists of the Burmese mainland and all of its vassal states), but I am very doubtful about labelling him \"Emperor of Lan Na\", \"Emperor of Siam\", \"Emperor of Lan Xang\" as if each of these were individual, separable titles (which I doubt).", "username": "RJFF", "rebuttal_labels": [], "coordination_labels": ["Coordinating edits"]}, {"text": "Hi , thanks for the thoughtful comments.", "username": "Hybernator", "rebuttal_labels": [], "coordination_labels": ["Coordinating edits"]}, {"text": "In Burmese, ''ekarit'' means emperor. For more academic definitions of the term ''ekarit'' (ekaraj) in English, see:  and\nThe chronicles do give his multitude of titles and names of his vassal states (including those that were more likely allies or protectorates in present-day India). But if you're asking if they specifically state in the form of: ''Ekarit'' of , no. (At least I haven't seen it.) Chroniclers, I don't believe, were thinking of in such neat academic terms.\nI'm not sure if there are commonly accepted criteria as to what constitutes an empire. Relatively small territories (Vietnam, Korea, Haiti) called themselves empires and their rulers emperors. Of course, even the Toungoo Empire at its height in the grand scheme of things was rather small in comparison to other large empires.\nFWIW, Lan Na was considered the most important, strategic vassal state by Bayinnaung and the Pegu court. The rank of the ruler of Lan Na was ''Bayin'' (\"king\") as was the case with Ayutthaya.\nNow, many Burmese kings had grandiose titles that equate to emperor even if their domain was no more than a small region. They called themselves ''Min Ekarit'', ''Sekkyawaday'', ''Maha Dhamma-Yaza'', ''Maha Dhamma-Yaza-Dipadi'', ''Razadarit'' (''Yazadarit''/Yaza-di-Yaza). For example, Binnya Nwe controlled just the Pegu province at his accession but nonetheless proclaimed himself as Razadarit (king of kings; Raja-dhi-Raja). Of course, several Siamese kings also had the title ''Rachathirat''.\nOverlord, to me, is a term of relative rank/position. The closest equivalent term in Burmese would be ''min'' which means lord but could refer to various office holders (governors, viceroys, or kings) or members of the royalty. A ''min'' could have vassals underneath him/her, and still have higher ranked overlords (''mins''). In the case of Burmese monarchs, they saw themselves as the top ranked ruler.
